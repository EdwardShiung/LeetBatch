# LeetBatch

LeetBatch is an automation tool for handling LeetCode submissions. The project is structured into four main layers: Database, Business Logic, Presentation, and Configuration.

## Features

- **Submit Single Question**: Submit a solution to a specific LeetCode problem using the API.
- **Submit Multiple Questions**: Submit solutions for all problems in the `QUESTION_MAPPING` and store the results in a CSV file.
- **Automated Result Parsing**: Retrieve and parse submission results, including status, runtime, memory usage, and error messages if any.
- **Flexible Language Support**: Supports multiple programming languages like Python, Java, C++, and etc.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- FastAPI
- Playwright
- CSV for result storage
- A `.env` file with your LeetCode credentials
- Get cookie information after logging in to LeetCode
- QUESTION_MAPPING and LANG_MAPPING settings

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EdwardShiung/LeetBatch.git
    cd leetcode_submission
    ```
2. Setup a virtual environment**

    It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies.

    - For MacOS/Linux, run:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    - For Windows, run:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    This will create and activate the virtual environment for your project.


3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Install Playwright:
    ```bash
    playwright install
    ```

5. Create a `.env` file and add your LeetCode credentials:
    ```
    LEETCODE_USERNAME=your_username
    LEETCODE_PASSWORD=your_password
    ```

6. Configure any additional settings in `config/settings.py` if needed (e.g., `DATA_FOLDER`).

## Organizing Your LeetCode Solutions

Please organize your LeetCode solutions in the following way:
- Create a folder named `leetcode_solutions` inside the `db/` directory.
- Inside the `leetcode_solutions` folder, save each solution in a separate file named as `leetcode_{question_id}.{language_extension}`, for example:
  - `leetcode_1.py` for a Python solution to the problem with ID 1.
  - `leetcode_3.java` for a Java solution to the problem with ID 3.

### Setting up `data_mappings.py`

You need to configure the `QUESTION_MAPPING` and `LANG_MAPPING` in the `db/data_mappings.py` file as follows:

```python
QUESTION_MAPPING = {
    1: "two-sum",
    3: "add-two-numbers",
    4: "median-of-two-sorted-arrays"
}

LANG_MAPPING = {
    "py": "python3",
    "java": "java",
    "cpp": "cpp",
    "js": "javascript"
}
```

- **`QUESTION_MAPPING`**: A dictionary that maps LeetCode question IDs to their respective problem names (slugs).
- **`LANG_MAPPING`**: A dictionary that maps programming language shortcuts to LeetCode's supported language codes.

## Cookies Setup

LeetCode requires you to have a valid session for submitting problems. After logging into your LeetCode account, you need to grab the session cookies and store them in a file called `cookies.json`.

Here is an example of the structure of `cookies.json`:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "LEETCODE_SESSION",
        "value": "your_session_value_here",
        "domain": ".leetcode.com",
        "path": "/",
        "httpOnly": true,
        "secure": true
    },
    {
        "name": "csrftoken",
        "value": "your_csrftoken_value_here",
        "domain": ".leetcode.com",
        "path": "/",
        "httpOnly": true,
        "secure": true
    }
]
```

### Instructions:
1. **Locate `LEETCODE_SESSION` and `csrftoken`** in your browser's developer tools while logged into LeetCode.
2. Copy the `value` fields of these cookies and paste them into the respective fields in the `cookies.json` file.
3. Make sure this file is placed in the root directory of your project for automatic usage during submissions.

## How to Run

To run the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn presentation.main:app --reload
```

### Submit a Single Question
Use the following endpoint to submit a single LeetCode problem:

**Endpoint**: `/api/submit/{question_id}`

**Example**:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/submit/1"
```

### Submit Multiple Questions
Use the following endpoint to submit all questions in the `QUESTION_MAPPING`:

**Endpoint**: `/api/submit_multi_questions`

**Example**:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/submit_multi_questions"
```

This will submit all the problems listed in `QUESTION_MAPPING` and save the results to a CSV file.
